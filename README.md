# CF7 Tanaguru

This repository is no more available because it was based on an old version of the Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin (the jQuery version).

Now, Contact Form 7 is available on GitHub and we have forked it the right way.
We have fixed again the accessibility issues in the new Vanilla version.
