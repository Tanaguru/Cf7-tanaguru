# Contact Form 7 Tanaguru

## Who are we ? Why this plugin ?
Tanaguru is a French-based team of web professionals focused on making the web more accessible. We support our clients' implementation of web accessibility, provide training courses and perform accessibility audits among other things. What's more, one of our field of actions is to develop accessible websites for our clients. 

Forms are an important part when it comes to web accessibility. We have used multiple times the WordPress Contact Form 7 and Contact Form 7 Accessible Defaults to create contact forms. 

Yet, we have found room for improvement in terms of web accessibility. 

This Contact Form 7 Tanaguru plugin aims at correcting and improving the original plugin.
